# CFB2019
A statistical analysis of the College Football 2019 season. I clean up the dataset, explore the data through graphs &amp; summary tables, and implement predictive models with the goal of utilizing the 2020 season to cross validate.

# EDA
I am working with a dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/jeffgallini/college-football-team-stats-2019) which describes 130 college teams belonging to the FBS.
There were no missing or duplicated values, but much of hte win/loss data was corrupted and incorrect.
